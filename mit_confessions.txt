MIT Confessions
February 25 at 8:30 PM · 
Hi all. For the past few years MIT Confessions has been passed down from admin to admin, with the general instructions becoming “post things that aren’t obviously troll posts”. As the current admins, we found this instruction simple at first, but over time things became complex as the page grew more popular and more and more people submitted confessions. Retroactively, we realize the change we had made in the posting styles for confessions wasn’t for the better. With that, we...

#20583 @20507 How misguided are you to be pissed off about a rent-a-cop telling you not to go inside a tent? There's an event. It's not public. Someone getting paid to stand outside a door probably doesn't give a shit about you, MIT, or the speakers. Why on earth would you harass some dude just putting in his hours and make a fuss about the deprioritization of "the quotidian education of the studentry", instead of walking around the tent and going to class? Is this the state of activism at MIT?

I wish smoking culture was still widely accepted. 
I get that there are communities that let you smoke inside your living quarters... but what if I wanna smoke a nice cigarette while I'm reading in a classroom? 
Like I get it, smoking is bad, but I hate having to walk outside just to enjoy a smoke break.
I wish that we could open up a smoking admissible lounge....

#20575 I like to think Kim Kardashian is mostly irrelevant to my life but every time I want to wear hoops I have to reconsider that because of her stupid "the bigger the hoops the bigger the hoe." sometimes hoops would just complete my look but because of Kim fucking K I can't wear them bc I'm not trying to be a hoe. honestly it's just a major inconvenience and I'm not sure why the stupid saying has become so widespread. Thank you for coming to my TED talk

#20573 Sometimes I have dreams where I'm lost in space. My oxygen is low and I have no way of returning to earth. Suddenly, I see a bright star travelling towards me. It's Xavier Zapien! He's come to save me! But wait, why does he only have one oxygen tank? He starts taking off my oxygen tank and replacing it with his. Then, he uses the last of his dying energy to accelerate me toward Earth. As I fall back to the motherland, I see Xavier's face shriveling from the vacuum of space. He looks like a raisin, but that's my raisin. Thank you Xavier-chan

#20569 Like others, I believe New Vassar Dorm is a very bad name. I have a good idea, I wish the student leaders can carry it forward.
Name the MIT Dorm as Tomlinson Hall. After Ray Tomlinson, the email pioneer. 
Reason:
In the MIT150 list of most influential MIT people, among the top 5, Tim Berners-Lee, Eric Lander and Philip Sharp are still alive. William Shockley is a no-no because of his racism. So, that leaves Ray Tomlinson, rest in peace. We all know that his work was g...

#20562 Keep the life and the family of Anthony Costa Jr. in your minds and hearts. He was a worker killed yesterday by scaffolding that fell at the construction site for the new Vassar dorm. Two other men are hospitalized with injuries. Whether this was a no-fault accident or the result of unsafe working conditions (investigation ongoing), MIT should be there for his loved ones and the injured. Costa was a member of the MIT community, even if, as a contracted worker, some others fail to recognize his value. Where is the email in his memory? This isn't just political; this is what is happening on our campus.

#20560 If MIT cared about their students, they would let BC residents move with their living groups to the Vassar dorm during renovations. It’s not even the culture aspect, it’s the fact that these are tight knit communities where residents feel safe talking to their fellow residents. Taking this away from those students, especially those who love their floors and primarily socialize there, is detrimental to both them and the greater MIT community.

If you have a problem with MIT admitting people who grew up with financial and/or educational privilege that's fine, but having a specific problem with admitting black/Hispanic privileged students makes the assumption that those people are inherently unqualified and...

#20557 Yet another survey from admin. While I'm generally satisfied with my MIT experience, I'll for sure be putting the most negative response for all the "does admin care about you" questions, and I encourage others to do the same, and here's why.
While my feelings aren't necessarily that extreme, more that I'm worried any answer that isn't the most extreme will be lumped in with all the ""these student's aren't extremely dissatisfied therefore they are satisfied"" responses. I wish I didn't have to worry about my opinion being misrepresented like this, but all the recent inaccurate data portrayals re:housing has made me defensive.

#20539 Though a series of unforeseen struggles continues to hold back the project, I'm getting closer than ever. One day, you'll finally understand why I had to do everything I did.
I'm proud to have liked you. May you find your special someone, and may that relationship be simple and delightful. Have a wonderful life.

#20535 Honestly, can we change the MacGregor fire alarm to only say the "if the alarm sounds in your half of the building, please evacuate" ONCE? Where I come from, if you hear the fire alarm, you instantly leave. We don't need the extra minute to rip our hair out over. Especially the pause before the second alarm. Is there ANY genuine point for this to exist instead of even, I don't know, INSTANTLY telling that half of MacGregor to leave? Almost seems like there could be serious issues if a real fire spread far enough to box people in while they were waiting to see if the alarm sounds for them.

#20534 I've had had serious moments of depression every semester I've been here. Usually it's related to some toxic relationship I've been in, but this semester, I'm in a pretty great relationship.
However, I'm going back into my depression cycle without an obvious thing I can point to as "the reason." My boyfriend thinks that my workload is too much, so I've thought of that being the possibility, but tbh, I like all my classes this semester and enjoy my time in all of them. ...

Sarah Owen Sometimes depression is cyclical and it could just be that it’s cycling back to a depressive episode. It doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s any particular stressor in your life right now. I’d recommend heading to Mental Health- I’ve had good results…See More

#20524 Today in 6.08 my lab partner was so kind and patient with me. I was having a rough morning and was seriously struggling to understand the lab but they were so nice about it and helped me learn the material. They clearly knew what they were doing and could have easily finished like a half hour early and ditched but they didn't and their kindness really brightened my day! Thank you to that person and I hope this post can spread some positivity.

#20522 Did you ever hear the tragedy of fructose the ketone-containing monosaccharide?
'No'
I thought not. It's not a story the corn industry would tell you. It's a low-carb legend. Fructose was a ketose so powerful and so wise, it could use biochemistry to influence the liver's mitochondria to create ... lipids. It had such a knowledge of metabolism, it could even keep the ones who ate it ... from being healthy. ...

#20515 To the person in 18.102 that constantly squeezes their water bottle and squirts out water:
PLEASE STOP!
The sound that this makes is VERY, VERY DISGUSTING and annoying! It is very easy to drink water without distracting the entire classroom. I am sitting in the opposite side of the room and I can still hear you. I am sure that I am not the only one that is annoyed because I see other people staring at you whenever you do it. 
I know it probably bothers me more than it should, but please stop.

#20497 I was in the Banana Lounge at like 12:30am and I'm pretty sure I saw a group of people walk in and take an entire box of bananas. What the fuck? I feel like this sort of behavior could lead us to losing this type of thing. Also, that is just plain abusive. I'm pretty sure I recognized one of them and know their name. If people are pissed enough at this, I'll call them out lol. Otherwise I'll assume I'm just overreacting.

#20493 PSA: Reasons why men wear shorts in the winter:
1. It’s convenient. 
2. Lots of pockets to store various odds and ends in. 
3. Sometimes they’re your most comfortable piece of clothing
Basically it’s safe, quick, and easy and everyone should try this at least once in their lifetimes, lest you regret it later. Eom.

#20490 Sometimes I wish I never came here. I had to adapt to this place while dealing with an eating phobia; literally being afraid to swallow fucking food. Life was terrible. But I'm happy to say that I'm getting over it. I think that it was a problem that stemmed from caring too much about what others thought of me. I would eat alone because of the anxiety, and I'm sorry to all the potential friends I alienated. Not giving a fuck has given me a sense of agency, and is making everything better. (Not sharing for pity, just feels therapeutic)

Ahmed Mahmoud It's called the M2 shuttle and goes through mass ave to Harvard Square and back all the way to Longwood, and you can use it with any Harvard or Longwood hospital ID. The institute could probably negotiate a deal to include MIT students

#20481 The guy I’m currently dating has an ex-girlfriend who is so much smarter than me, and I feel like I have to always prove myself or pretend to be smarter than I actually am. Plus, I feel like if he had the chance, he’d go back to her. I can’t tell if my insecurities are legitimate or if I’m just lacking confidence.

Yida Wang ohhh yeah... thats a filler word in mandarin, it literally means "that". some ppl use it like the way english speakers use oh, uh, um, like, etc. It's written in pinyin like "ne ga", as two separate words. idk about other languages but promise its not intentional
