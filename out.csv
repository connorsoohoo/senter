I have a decently large group of close friends, and I enjoyed being around them all of frosh year, but lately Iâ€™ve felt as though I donâ€™t connect with them on a deeper level. I often want to talk about things outside of Caltech -- relationships, social/global issues, opinions, long-term goals, books, etc. -- but my friends arenâ€™t into that and prefer to discuss sets most of the time. Iâ€™ve found that for a friendship to seem real to me, we have to show some vulnerabilities around each other or trust each other with some slightly personal information (not just things like Iâ€™m worried about how a final went), and I donâ€™t feel that with my friends. I get almost no enjoyment being around them because all the conversation feels superficial -- discussions about sets and other goings on at Caltech for the most part.They are truly kind, wonderful people, but I just donâ€™t feel that I can have a true friendship with them when I feel like we canâ€™t discuss personal issues or thoughts with each other. I feel more alone when I am surrounded by my friends than when Iâ€™m physically alone. I think this may partially have to do with a lack of shared interests. I expect that I would have a great time in grad school connecting with people who have similar interests, but I donâ€™t want to feel alone during the rest of college or as though I didnâ€™t make any lasting friendships in college. Has anyone had similar experiences at Caltech or have any advice?

Recently i found this copypasta in subtle asian traits lol i thought id share. In short, instead of being bitter and blaming the opposite gender, actually work to counter this stereotype. Especially in a place like caltech.""<TW: Politically incorrect content>This is a long rant but as an Asian male, I'm sick and tired of other Asian males bitching and moaning about being incompetitive in the dating pool.On one hand, yes, us asian males tend to hang out on the bottom end of the desirability pool. Most of us are going to get shit all over on tinder. And yeah, the media systematically tries to emasculate us even while they oversexualize our female counterparts. It sucks, but whoop de fucking doo. Big fucking boo hoo. Our black brothers are getting shot out there for doing literally nothing wrong. Our latino brothers are getting kicked out of their country, the only country they know. Many many people have it MUCH worse than you. Us asian males are statistically likely to be more educated, get lighter sentencing, make more money, etc. We have it so good compared to other minorities, but your overentitled sorry bitchasses come to this bubble of a school and cry about not being served attractive women on a silver platter; yknow, the same way you had your education and relatively easy childhood served on a silver platter.It sucks but yknow what, those of you who complain the most - the MOST single of you single mofos - most of yall dont do shit to improve your situation. Let me give you some short examples and some tips on how to fix them.1) fucking be clean. I dont know why the fuck so many traditional asian families dont teach cleanliness, but you need to be fucking clean. Shower every day. Do your fucking laundry. Wear a fresh shirt every day or at least ""rest"" them before you wear them again. Trim your nails. Shave. You and I both know we grow patchy ass spider legs out of our face so fucking get rid of it all every single fucking day. And for the love of god, get your pube situation under control. No woman wants to fucking machete their way through 8 feet of pubes to find 2 inches of dick. Use nonscented deoderant and wear a scent. Seriously, nautica cologne is like 25 bucks on amazon and its decent. If your skin looks like the face of the moon, start taking care of that shit.2) have a sense of style. Youre not fucking 12 anymore. Free t shirt from your dad's work event, cargo pants/shorts, white crew socks, and your tennis shoes from 10th grade arent going to cut it in the real world. Look around at what other guys - especially the ones that have attractive girlfriends - are wearing and do something similar. Here, ill give you a freebie...v neck solid color shirt, properly fit jeans, and your choice of not-fucking-tennis-shoes-oh-my-god-youre-not-15-anymore. Your free tshirts that youve worn to death that are now full of holes are NOT acceptable. Oh and do something about your hair. You dont need a kpop star hairdo...but your overgrown, unwashed, unstyled generic asian cut isn't exactly helping you get the punanifruit juices flowing.3) ""oh ya i cant follow step 1 and 2 because I don't have money and my parents wont pay for it"" TF you wait WOT now?!? Bitch you are in COLLEGE. You are a fully legal adult. TF you MEAN your parents wont pay for it. Get your fucking shit together and find your bitch ass a fucking J O B, ya overpriviledged ass never-had-a-hard-day-of-work ass mom-and-dad-pay-for-everything ass mofucka. Lets say the stars align and your crush actually agrees to a date. Tf you gon do, take them to cafe V? Please, in the name of all that is good: THE BISTRO IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE FIRST DATE SPOT. Please. Please stop. Please. Plus, working will help with the next one...4) have a fucking PERSONALITY. This one is free.99 so theres literally no excuse to not have one. Learn some jokes, think of some interesting stories, etc. Become a cultured individual. Put down the fucking video games for like 15 minutes a day and read some philosophy, look at some art, learn some pop culture. Seriously, all you fuckers know is your major and video games. You take your date to not-the-bistro and then what? You gonna sit there in silence? Just nod your head every time she tries to engage you because you can recite all 150 original pokemon but you dont know anything about anything else? No you stupid fuck...smile, tell her about yourself, have some shit to talk about, and LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS. ""Hurr durr well ill just find a pretty girl whos also into video games and anime like me"". Do you KNOW how highly demanded those girls are? Even the eh looking ones are highly demanded. You and every other generic asian male is after the tiny, TINY population of anime/gamer chick, PLUS she needs to like you back. Being well cultured makes you much more competitive in that ultra-competitive niche, but it also lets you DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO. Yes, by being well cultured, well mannered, friendly, clean, and well dressed, YOU TOO can have a shot at the mystical ABG. Btw Idfk WHY yall have such raging boners for em...you know its literally all just makeup right? Take an ABG swimming...she dives in instagram model and comes out looking night-before-the-SAT5) swallow your fucking huge ass ego. Jesus fuggin christ idk WHY so many of yall have such big egos but theyre not deserved and theyre a huge turn off. I cant tell you how many times ive wanted to punch an asian dude in the fucking face because their ego was so so so cringeworthy. Be humble. Be sincere. Be genuine. You aint slick and youre not god's gift to man. Youre often wrong, you have flaws, and nobody is obligated to like you. And for fuck's sake, you dont OWN women. Women dont owe you SHIT. Idc how nice you think you are: start assuming that you are a huge asshole and start measuring the impact of your actions and words. Start looking for feedback on how you do things and approach that criticism constructively instead of screaming that youre perfect the way you are. Bitch, the way you are is v SINGLE and that shit wont change if you dont.6) you uncle chongs need to fucking stop. Youre not white and you never will be, so stop suppressing our black and latino brothers. Theres meaningful and honest dialogue to have about race relations among minorities, but fucking hold me BACK because I SWEAR ima FUQ UP the next clueless asian dickweed who says """"well they deserved to get shot by the cops because [insert typical dickweed reason]"""". Yall are like crabs in a pot...instead of working with each other to escape yall pull each other back into the boiling water and then bitch and moan that things arent getting better for you.7) get some exercise. Nobody is trying to get impaled on your bony ass. Get some mass and some tone in you. If youre overweight like me, start eating right and do some cardio. You dont need to be a model but you need to show you care at least somewhat.At the end of the day, theres a good chance your crush is still going to reject you. And thats okay. This is a numbers game. Asian men as a category might be placed lower than everybody else, but you can be the top of your class...that alone is going to do wonders for you. And honestly, we're not too bad when we're done up properly.If youre a single asian male crying about not finding a partner and you choose not to listen to any of this, your present situation is your own friggin fault and I feel nothing for you. Youre not even an involuntary celibate, youre a voluntary one. You chose this for yourself.Ladies, if you have more to add please do. I would love to learn something new to try.Yours in faith,Anonymous Asian Dude""",-0.9824,0.144,0.158,0.698,1/6/19 13:11

"I'm glad that after spending basically the entire fall term ready to burst into tears at any second from the massive academic and job hunting stress, I was able to spend my entire break at home crying and fighting with my shitty, emotionally abusive family every single day. I can't wait to go back to Caltech, so I can spend 10 weeks struggling and forgetting how terrible home is. But then I remember that I am stuck with this family forever, and it instantly brings me to tears.I don't believe in God. Sometimes I think about how I am so lucky to have been born into a circumstance that has given me the opportunity to go one of the best colleges in the world. Then I think about how terrible my home life is, and that contrast sometimes makes me think that I was given this familial situation in exchange for my opportunities in life. I know that millions more people have worse home lives and vastly fewer opportunities and that even my situation may be a dream for many. I just truly detest the idea of starting a family one day and having the obligation of my current nuclear family be a part of their lives.",0.666,0.131,0.134,0.735,1/3/19 5:02

"One of the reasons why I chose to go to Caltech is the House system. Originally, I viewed the House system favorably, since the system claims to combine the best elements of fraternities and dormitories. However, my experiences in the House system have not generally been positive. I ranked my House fifth during Rotation, and for this reason, I had the feeling from day one that I would not make it into the in-crowd. Sure enough, starting from the moment the cannon fired, most of my social interactions in the House led to my being relegated to the out-crowd, despite my efforts to not end up in the out-crowd. I drifted slowly but steadily away from my House in my first two years at Tech, despite living in my House throughout that time and participating in most of the House events I was able to. I chose to live in Bechtel this year precisely because I felt like an outsider in my House during that time (Iâ€™ve done a really good job convincing myself and others to believe the lie that there are other reasons why I chose to live in Bechtel this year).I think that the in-crowd/out-crowd divide is a consequence of the House system, and Iâ€™m surprised very few students have spoken out about it already. I think the divide is a consequence of the House system because it is not only something that occurs in my House (I have experienced it firsthand and I have seen it play out among my housemates), but also something that occurs in other Houses (I have made many observations with students in other Houses that are consistent with this belief).Members of the in-crowd are supported socially by most other members of the House. They get recognition within the House for being good examples of what members of the House should strive to be (whatever â€œgoodâ€ù means). They run in House elections and covet the positive social attention House positions draw to them. They always stay in the know about whatâ€™s going on in the House even without official announcements. They love living in the House, and most remain on-campus for all of their time at Tech. And their friend groups tend to line up nicely with respect to House boundaries.On the other hand, members of the out-crowd have no choice but to fend for themselves. They donâ€™t get recognition within the House for being good examples of what members of the House should strive to be, and many of them are never mentioned within House circles except perhaps occasionally in passing. They donâ€™t run in House elections because they know they have no chance whatsoever of winning House positions. When official announcements arenâ€™t made, they sometimes donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on in the House because unfortunately, people canâ€™t read minds. They tend to not love living in the House, often for legitimate reasons (board is too expensive/not accommodating enough, rooms in the House are too loud, etc.), and most move off-campus at some point after frosh year. And their friend groups tend to be very fragmented in terms of House representation.On the whole, I like my House specifically and the House system as a whole. But in practice, the House system leads to a sharp divide between the in-crowd and the out-crowd. It shouldnâ€™t be that wayâ€”there shouldnâ€™t be an out-crowd in the first place, and every member of the House should feel as welcome to participate in House events as every other member does. The one major regret I know Iâ€™m going to have when I graduate from Tech is that I didnâ€™t make it into the in-crowd of my House, and itâ€™s something I think about more and more these days as my time at Tech passes by.",0.9965,0.121,0.03,0.849,12/27/18 12:12

The individuals I met who are the most helpful and supportive in an academic environment are smart, yes, and some of the hardest working I know, but they have not been the brightest of Caltech. The brightest stars in the student community have been the least helpful. They don't make themselves accessible to the community, they create an elite group within students of their kind. Administration and faculty notice these students and exacerbate the problem by keeping opportunities exclusive to these students and, therefore, prohibiting access to other students. And this problem exists since the first year of undergraduate. Students who enter with a silver spoon of opportunities become part of this elite community and then have opportunities thrown at them by Caltech. Students who had to work their asses off to get to Caltech, who did not have backgrounds that make them exclusive at Caltech (econ, race, geo, rare opportunities in high school, highly rewarding scholarships that they can't qualify for because of factors beyond their control) have to work ten times harder for even the opportunity to hear what the exclusive community of students can hear. These would be the best students to give extraordinary opportunities because these are the students who amplify the talent of those around them. Their talent allows them to receive knowledge, but their selflessness allows them to disseminate knowledge to raise a whole community. Most of us are diamonds in the rough. We came into Caltech to become the shiniest possible diamonds ever. We listened to the advice of the administration: we asked for help, we went to office hours, we sent the emails, we talked and networked with whoever would talk to us, we used the career development center, we did SURFs, we sought everything thrown to us. Yet we will most likely leave with several of our original dark spots, and the shiny diamonds will leave shinier. You don't have to deprive them of opportunities to be shinier. But let us have our chance to become the same as them.",0.9953,0.192,0.051,0.757,12/13/18 15:30
"I'm in my first real relationship and I've realized I'm not that physically attracted to him. He's an awesome person and not ugly at all but he's so plain and his body doesn't do anything for me. I always imagined my college relationship would be full of sex but we barely do it now unless I'm feeling particularly guilty that day, and even when we do I can't stop imagining those buff guys I see at Braun on top of me instead which makes me feel even worse. Should I be blaming myself so much for this? What should I do? ",-0.7865,0.095,0.13,0.775,12/13/18 19:13

My favorite point in the term is when all of your work is turned it but your grades havenâ€™t been posted yet so they just exist in a superpositioned state between all Aâ€™s and all Fâ€™s,0.25,0.056,0,0.944,12/14/18 9:59
