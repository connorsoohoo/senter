2/21/2019 19:50:12,"Why doesn't every class utilize some method of showing us what our grades are throughout the term and how final grades are calculated? Also I'm sure that, especially in large classes, errors in gradekeeping are hard to avoid completely, so why can't there be a way for us to verify that the records are correct? Since all we get in the end is a single letter grade, I'm often left wondering how accurately it actually reflects my work."

Upperclassmen continuously bring up how this school broke them or left them demoralized for their academic futures, and i'm scared that i'm starting to become the same way. I don't want to view school and the classes I take the same way as them because I can hear how miserable this school has made them, but the words they used to describe their pain are starting to become the same words I hear in my head.

2/12/2019 2:25:32,"how common is it here for people to barely talk to their roommates? my roommate and I don't dislike each other (at least I don't dislike them and idt they dislike me), but we just never talk. we just ignore each other for the most part, but I find this really awkward because I'm very much aware of their presence most of the time."
2/12/2019 2:34:15,"One time my friend and I decided not to do a set and instead go on a live video chat website to talk to strangers. I think we ended up dropping the class together, but at least we befriended a 12-year-old Filipino from across the world who sung and danced for us.

2/10/2019 17:42:04,"(CW for suicide mention) I'm at the point where I wouldn't kill myself because I'm too much of a weakling to even think about being in that much pain, but I really wish that I had when I was always actively planning on it in high school. At least that way I wouldn't keep being a fucking waste of food, space, money, and other people's time. I don't even know why I bother getting extensions, or at least tryjng to get extensions, on things, honestly, I'm a failure of a human being and my grades should really reflect that, but instead I've never gotten anything below a B- in my life, so everyone thinks I'm doing absolutely dandy!

I mean, I still could, in theory, do it, but I don't really care enough to. I guess it's ironic to not care enough about anything to the point that you can't even be bothered to off yourself because that would be effort that you don't have, but ah well. Who fucking cares."

However, there were a few times in the last couple years of tech when the workload got very stressful. Words were said and actions were taken that we have long since pushed down and (I think) repressed. I hope it hasn't taken a toll on their attitudes toward our friendship, but I feel like it's too awkward to bring up now and ask if it is ever something they think about. I'm sorry fellas, much love."
2/9/2019 20:03:20,"So... that state of the Union address. Trump made all of these statements about how unemployment is down, how minority unemployment has hit an all-time low, how people with disabilities are working... and Democrat Congressmen aren't clapping for this? Sure, I never expected it to turn out positively, but these ARE good results, right? Were people not clapping just because Trump was the one who said it? Even if he has flaws elsewhere, shouldn't you offer praise when something good happens to encourage it? At the very least it offers credibility when trying to work a compromise. But these people seem so petty, and I feel so disillusioned... It really feels like some people would prefer to see the US crash and burn just to spite Trump rather than see the US do well because ""an enemy"" would be sharing some credit."

2/4/2019 20:58:40,"How the hell do you tell someone to stop being a gigantic fucking asshole when you're not at all close to them and you're worried about coming off as an asshole to them? Someone in my year in Booty House is just a generally unpleasant person to be around, but the ways in which they're unpleasant are COMPLETELY fixable if someone just told them. The problem is that they constantly act like a pariah when people even disagree with them, so telling them feels pretty fucking impossible too.

I don't know how to fix this at all. I just constantly get stressed out just being around this person because of their assholery, but I also really don't want to call them out on their shitty behavior in case they try to retaliate somehow. (I almost left them an anonymous note our frosh year telling them to stop being such an asshole, but I'm glad in retrospect that I didn't because that sounds like a shitty thing to do too.)"

I had pretty shitty grades then (think multiple classes a term with low Bs and lower - the only classes I had As in were hums) and even failed one. And I know this really is no excuse, but it was because I was going through some pretty bad depression, and it was really hard to get out of that rut for some time. But I did eventually get out! I have grades I am satisfied with now. However, that period of time still haunts me. What do I do? I know I could always try to explain why that happened, but I am afraid if I talk about depression, they will be afraid I will get another episode and not take the risk with me.

1/26/2019 20:23:01,"I’ve been struggling with a lack of connection with my friends here at Caltech. I have a decently large group of close friends, and I enjoyed being around them all of frosh year, but lately I’ve felt as though I don’t connect with them on a deeper level. I often want to talk about things outside of Caltech -- relationships, social/global issues, opinions, long-term goals, books, etc. -- but my friends aren’t into that and prefer to discuss sets most of the time. I’ve found that for a friendship to seem real to me, we have to show some vulnerabilities around each other or trust each other with some slightly personal information (not just things like I’m worried about how a final went), and I don’t feel that with my friends. I get almost no enjoyment being around them because all the conversation feels superficial -- discussions about sets and other goings on at Caltech for the most part.

They are truly kind, wonderful people, but I just don’t feel that I can have a true friendship with them when I feel like we can’t discuss personal issues or thoughts with each other. I feel more alone when I am surrounded by my friends than when I’m physically alone. I think this may partially have to do with a lack of shared interests. I expect that I would have a great time in grad school connecting with people who have similar interests, but I don’t want to feel alone during the rest of college or as though I didn’t make any lasting friendships in college. Has anyone had similar experiences at Caltech or have any advice? I expect that I should go out and make new friends, and I have a bit, but it’s also somewhat difficult when you’re not a frosh and most people have established their social circles already. "

1/27/2019 3:01:17,"I agree with the people who say the tech editors should be impeached. Caltech students collectively took a joke too far and replaced the real editors who dedicated much of their Caltech career to the newspaper with people who admitted they weren't even trying to win and now the newspaper is just filled with low quality content. Why are the editors even elected when stuff like yearbook isn't, idk. My biggest concern is that the election led to all the old staff not working for the tech anymore and so now the current staff are really overworked and the quality of the tech is really suffering as a result. I get that most people don't really think about shit like this but I'm sure some of however much you pay in dues to ascit goes to printing a bunch of papers that mostly get tossed in the trash anyway, we should at least exercise some control over the quality. None of this is intended to be personal to anyone but I just hope the Tech improves somehow."

This reality is disheartening and frustrating for many of us, but i also believe most of us have the wrong attitude about it. Recently i found this copypasta in subtle asian traits lol i thought id share. In short, instead of being bitter and blaming the opposite gender, actually work to counter this stereotype. Especially in a place like caltech.

""<TW: Politically incorrect content>
This is a long rant but as an Asian male, I'm sick and tired of other Asian males bitching and moaning about being incompetitive in the dating pool.

On one hand, yes, us asian males tend to hang out on the bottom end of the desirability pool. Most of us are going to get shit all over on tinder. And yeah, the media systematically tries to emasculate us even while they oversexualize our female counterparts. It sucks, but whoop de fucking doo. Big fucking boo hoo. Our black brothers are getting shot out there for doing literally nothing wrong. Our latino brothers are getting kicked out of their country, the only country they know. Many many people have it MUCH worse than you. Us asian males are statistically likely to be more educated, get lighter sentencing, make more money, etc. We have it so good compared to other minorities, but your overentitled sorry bitchasses come to this bubble of a school and cry about not being served attractive women on a silver platter; yknow, the same way you had your education and relatively easy childhood served on a silver platter.

It sucks but yknow what, those of you who complain the most - the MOST single of you single mofos - most of yall dont do shit to improve your situation. Let me give you some short examples and some tips on how to fix them.

1) fucking be clean. I dont know why the fuck so many traditional asian families dont teach cleanliness, but you need to be fucking clean. Shower every day. Do your fucking laundry. Wear a fresh shirt every day or at least ""rest"" them before you wear them again. Trim your nails. Shave. You and I both know we grow patchy ass spider legs out of our face so fucking get rid of it all every single fucking day. And for the love of god, get your pube situation under control. No woman wants to fucking machete their way through 8 feet of pubes to find 2 inches of dick. Use nonscented deoderant and wear a scent. Seriously, nautica cologne is like 25 bucks on amazon and its decent. If your skin looks like the face of the moon, start taking care of that shit.

2) have a sense of style. Youre not fucking 12 anymore. Free t shirt from your dad's work event, cargo pants/shorts, white crew socks, and your tennis shoes from 10th grade arent going to cut it in the real world. Look around at what other guys - especially the ones that have attractive girlfriends - are wearing and do something similar. Here, ill give you a freebie...v neck solid color shirt, properly fit jeans, and your choice of not-fucking-tennis-shoes-oh-my-god-youre-not-15-anymore. Your free tshirts that youve worn to death that are now full of holes are NOT acceptable. Oh and do something about your hair. You dont need a kpop star hairdo...but your overgrown, unwashed, unstyled generic asian cut isn't exactly helping you get the punanifruit juices flowing.

3) ""oh ya i cant follow step 1 and 2 because I don't have money and my parents wont pay for it"" TF you wait WOT now?!? Bitch you are in COLLEGE. You are a fully legal adult. TF you MEAN your parents wont pay for it. Get your fucking shit together and find your bitch ass a fucking J O B, ya overpriviledged ass never-had-a-hard-day-of-work ass mom-and-dad-pay-for-everything ass mofucka. Lets say the stars align and your crush actually agrees to a date. Tf you gon do, take them to cafe V? Please, in the name of all that is good: THE BISTRO IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE FIRST DATE SPOT. Please. Please stop. Please. Plus, working will help with the next one...

4) have a fucking PERSONALITY. This one is free.99 so theres literally no excuse to not have one. Learn some jokes, think of some interesting stories, etc. Become a cultured individual. Put down the fucking video games for like 15 minutes a day and read some philosophy, look at some art, learn some pop culture. Seriously, all you fuckers know is your major and video games. You take your date to not-the-bistro and then what? You gonna sit there in silence? Just nod your head every time she tries to engage you because you can recite all 150 original pokemon but you dont know anything about anything else? No you stupid fuck...smile, tell her about yourself, have some shit to talk about, and LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS. ""Hurr durr well ill just find a pretty girl whos also into video games and anime like me"". Do you KNOW how highly demanded those girls are? Even the eh looking ones are highly demanded. You and every other generic asian male is after the tiny, TINY population of anime/gamer chick, PLUS she needs to like you back. Being well cultured makes you much more competitive in that ultra-competitive niche, but it also lets you DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO. Yes, by being well cultured, well mannered, friendly, clean, and well dressed, YOU TOO can have a shot at the mystical ABG. Btw Idfk WHY yall have such raging boners for em...you know its literally all just makeup right? Take an ABG swimming...she dives in instagram model and comes out looking night-before-the-SAT

5) swallow your fucking huge ass ego. Jesus fuggin christ idk WHY so many of yall have such big egos but theyre not deserved and theyre a huge turn off. I cant tell you how many times ive wanted to punch an asian dude in the fucking face because their ego was so so so cringeworthy. Be humble. Be sincere. Be genuine. You aint slick and youre not god's gift to man. Youre often wrong, you have flaws, and nobody is obligated to like you. And for fuck's sake, you dont OWN women. Women dont owe you SHIT. Idc how nice you think you are: start assuming that you are a huge asshole and start measuring the impact of your actions and words. Start looking for feedback on how you do things and approach that criticism constructively instead of screaming that youre perfect the way you are. Bitch, the way you are is v SINGLE and that shit wont change if you dont.

6) you uncle chongs need to fucking stop. Youre not white and you never will be, so stop suppressing our black and latino brothers. Theres meaningful and honest dialogue to have about race relations among minorities, but fucking hold me BACK because I SWEAR ima FUQ UP the next clueless asian dickweed who says """"well they deserved to get shot by the cops because [insert typical dickweed reason]"""". Yall are like crabs in a pot...instead of working with each other to escape yall pull each other back into the boiling water and then bitch and moan that things arent getting better for you.

7) get some exercise. Nobody is trying to get impaled on your bony ass. Get some mass and some tone in you. If youre overweight like me, start eating right and do some cardio. You dont need to be a model but you need to show you care at least somewhat.

At the end of the day, theres a good chance your crush is still going to reject you. And thats okay. This is a numbers game. Asian men as a category might be placed lower than everybody else, but you can be the top of your class...that alone is going to do wonders for you. And honestly, we're not too bad when we're done up properly.

If youre a single asian male crying about not finding a partner and you choose not to listen to any of this, your present situation is your own friggin fault and I feel nothing for you. Youre not even an involuntary celibate, youre a voluntary one. You chose this for yourself.

Ladies, if you have more to add please do. I would love to learn something new to try.

Yours in faith,
Anonymous Asian Dude"""

I can't wait to go back to Caltech, so I can spend 10 weeks struggling and forgetting how terrible home is. But then I remember that I am stuck with this family forever, and it instantly brings me to tears.

I don't believe in God. Sometimes I think about how I am so lucky to have been born into a circumstance that has given me the opportunity to go one of the best colleges in the world. Then I think about how terrible my home life is, and that contrast sometimes makes me think that I was given this familial situation in exchange for my opportunities in life. I know that millions more people have worse home lives and vastly fewer opportunities and that even my situation may be a dream for many. I just truly detest the idea of starting a family one day and having the obligation of my current nuclear family be a part of their lives."

Every waking moment of my life I think of them, and every sleeping moment I dream of them.  I can't live without them...but alas, I do.

12/27/2018 12:12:44,"One of the reasons why I chose to go to Caltech is the House system. Originally, I viewed the House system favorably, since the system claims to combine the best elements of fraternities and dormitories. However, my experiences in the House system have not generally been positive. I ranked my House fifth during Rotation, and for this reason, I had the feeling from day one that I would not make it into the in-crowd. Sure enough, starting from the moment the cannon fired, most of my social interactions in the House led to my being relegated to the out-crowd, despite my efforts to not end up in the out-crowd. I drifted slowly but steadily away from my House in my first two years at Tech, despite living in my House throughout that time and participating in most of the House events I was able to. I chose to live in Bechtel this year precisely because I felt like an outsider in my House during that time (I’ve done a really good job convincing myself and others to believe the lie that there are other reasons why I chose to live in Bechtel this year).
I think that the in-crowd/out-crowd divide is a consequence of the House system, and I’m surprised very few students have spoken out about it already. I think the divide is a consequence of the House system because it is not only something that occurs in my House (I have experienced it firsthand and I have seen it play out among my housemates), but also something that occurs in other Houses (I have made many observations with students in other Houses that are consistent with this belief).
Members of the in-crowd are supported socially by most other members of the House. They get recognition within the House for being good examples of what members of the House should strive to be (whatever “good” means). They run in House elections and covet the positive social attention House positions draw to them. They always stay in the know about what’s going on in the House even without official announcements. They love living in the House, and most remain on-campus for all of their time at Tech. And their friend groups tend to line up nicely with respect to House boundaries.
On the other hand, members of the out-crowd have no choice but to fend for themselves. They don’t get recognition within the House for being good examples of what members of the House should strive to be, and many of them are never mentioned within House circles except perhaps occasionally in passing. They don’t run in House elections because they know they have no chance whatsoever of winning House positions. When official announcements aren’t made, they sometimes don’t know what’s going on in the House because unfortunately, people can’t read minds. They tend to not love living in the House, often for legitimate reasons (board is too expensive/not accommodating enough, rooms in the House are too loud, etc.), and most move off-campus at some point after frosh year. And their friend groups tend to be very fragmented in terms of House representation.
On the whole, I like my House specifically and the House system as a whole. But in practice, the House system leads to a sharp divide between the in-crowd and the out-crowd. It shouldn’t be that way—there shouldn’t be an out-crowd in the first place, and every member of the House should feel as welcome to participate in House events as every other member does. The one major regret I know I’m going to have when I graduate from Tech is that I didn’t make it into the in-crowd of my House, and it’s something I think about more and more these days as my time at Tech passes by."

Following some of my own academic complications, my parents don't want me to continue going to this school. They've said that if I want to continue attending Caltech, then I have to find some way to pay for it myself. Honestly, it's their decision what to do with their hard-earned money.

I really like her she's pretty perfect and I thought that it would work out between us. But I have so much things to do in Caltech and had no time to put into our relationship so I broke up with her before finals. I feel bad but our relationship seemed pointless when we had nothing in common in different colleges. Thoughts?
12/23/2018 17:49:26,"theres a song i really like but the album cover image or whatever is a sexualized anthro MLP pony (who i think is a child in the show?)

caltech, am i good? (and also is there a way to replace the album art on spotify?)"
12/23/2018 21:46:58,When I go home all of my friends and family call me “the genius” or “the smart one” and expect that I’m getting straight A’s like I did in highschool. It makes it really hard to be honest with them about school because I am struggling and theres no way I am still getting A’s here. They all think so highly of me and I feel like I’m letting them down with my subpar academic performance.
12/23/2018 22:21:21,"Today, I had to explain to a very close friend of mine why it's not okay to keep pressuring a girl to have sex with him despite him getting signs that she's uncomfortable with the situation. I understand that there are definitely clueless people out there but I never thought it would be someone so close to me, you know? Heck, it would have been better if he DIDN'T notice that she was uncomfortable. He KNEW and yet he kept on going. Thank god she was nice about it, told him (despite it being after the fact), and ended things with him (good for her), but I just can't help but see this friend of mine in a different light after this incident. "
12/23/2018 23:25:49,Anyone have experience starting a relationship with someone off campus they didn’t know before coming here? Met this girl but she’s about 45 min away and I’m not sure if I’m crazy to just go for it or if it’ll ruin things for me here
12/24/2018 4:08:40,"When does it finally become acceptable to kill yourself? I'm by far the most pathetic I know in all facets of life. I'm physically repulsive, socially retarded, kinda stupid, and honestly I just dont know how much longer I can handle it. I try, I really do, but nothing ever works out. Everyone around me seems to be making progress in at least some area of their lives, while I'm just standing by hoping that one day I'll finally get hit by a car. I'm tired of disappointing everyone. I'm tired of being a loser. "
12/20/2018 22:31:22,"I just found out I'm pregnant. It's definitely my ex's. I'm not keeping it. Do I still have a moral obligation to tell him about it? We broke up a couple months ago and I think he just started seeing someone new. I'm worried that telling him will just add unnecessary drama to his life and his new relationship, but keeping it secret also seems wrong."
12/21/2018 0:54:13,"I legally have a micropenis. I always lightheartedly tell people I have a micropenis because I want it to seem like a joke. That way if a girl ever tells someone about it, they'll think it's still people joking around"
12/21/2018 8:41:44,"do grad students and profs get copies of tqfrs/feedback reports? if anyone needs
to read those, its them since people not taking a class wont do anything to the instructor esp if its a req class"
12/21/2018 9:12:56,"Team projects at Caltech are a total disappointment. When I called out someone for not doing any productive work in my team, that person got all mad and defensive (their actions seemed to suggest they lost their mind) and stopped communicating with me entirely instead of addressing their ​own ​lack of work. Why can’t people do the work they’re supposed to do in a team environment and stop getting mad at those who carry them through the class​ (they should at least be grateful for those who are carrying them)​?"
12/21/2018 9:58:23,I think the seniors' class gift should be to fill the hole in the brick walkway on the northeast corner outside of fleming with an actual brick. it can say 'class of 2019' and everything.

12/20/2018 16:04:07,"~15 year alum here.Hooked up with a girl I know through a joined hobby. She said she liked me for a while, but didn't say so because she didn't want me to think she wanted me for my money. Took me a min of confusion to remember that yeah my  stocks are worth a few million now, and I own my own condo, so in said social group I'm by far the richest person.
Where did the time go? where did the money come from? I'm still a poor college student struggling to get B's at heart
Anyway, I guess what I want to say is that (financially) it gets so much easier  after Tech. B's in Tech means major expert outside effort-wise. but socially it's get a bit weird"
12/20/2018 18:11:21,"Im bi. I don’t think I could date anyone of my same gender though because it wouldn’t be able to go anywhere. My family would never approve, and I love my family. I know they’d never accept it and I wouldn’t want to lose them. "
12/20/2018 18:35:32,"It feels like everyone around me is dating someone, and I'm always the single one. Friend groups at school, friend groups at home, even my siblings. I've gone through the whole ""you gotta love yourself thing""; I'm great at that, I've been keeping up with my hobbies, and I've been putting a lot of work into improving myself. I can keep myself occupied all day. But none of that changes what I feel as I go to bed, which is complete and utter loneliness.

What's the point of going on if you don't have a meaningful impact in others' lives? Sure, I have some good platonic friendships, but none of those people are gonna wake up or go to sleep and think of me. If you only live for yourself, does your life really have meaning? I just wish I knew how to stop feeling so god damn lonely.

I've gotten close a few times, but things always go wrong. I rarely feel a connection with the people that are into me, and the ones that I do feel a connection with just end up ghosting me. Could I be the problem? Are my standards just too high? Am I just doomed to be alone forever? I just want someone to care about me as much as I care about them.

Any advice would be nice, there's nothing like recognizing an oncoming depressive break and not knowing how to get out of the way."
12/20/2018 0:44:04,"I'm behind for health reasons and I know I won't graduate by the end of my senior year. Every term I hear people complain about unit/unit posts making them feel insecure and I feel weird because the people complaining aren't more behind than I am. I'm not ashamed to not graduate in 4 years or to take extensions past the end of term late once in a while on one hand. But on the other I hate the idea of people who don't know me assuming my competence or intelligence. Some people talk about their incomplete units anyway, I guess I'm not brave like that. Cheers to you if you are though. Good job and congratulations if you do finish on time, and lastly for the ones who are behind like me and feel bad-or-weird when the unit posts roll around: you're also doing a good job and I'm proud of us even if we struggle sometimes."
12/20/2018 1:25:28,"I don’t understand posts on this page where people are like Caltech is shitty but at least people here are great wouldn’t get through it without them. I’ve consistently felt like the people here are really shitty, awful, and toxic. I feel like the main reason I’ve had a hard time here is the people."
12/18/2018 21:53:07,"I've been depressed/anxious(/who knows what else, I probably have a few personality disorders in there) for so long that I don't think I even have a personality outside of my brain problems anymore. That's especially true about the personality disorders, since, yknow, it's in the name. That said, I've been high-functioning for an equally long time, so nobody actually notices that I'm any of these things. The closest anyone has come was when someone in middle school noticed I was never in the cafeteria - which was right, I ate lunch in the bathroom then - but even my own parents haven't noticed anything. That's by design, but still.

I don't know. I legitimately don't think therapy would be helpful for me in any way whatsoever, since every time I read literal DBT/CBT  (I know, they're different, I'be looked at both) questions I roll my eyes. I have literally no reason to be all of these things, since my childhood was fine and I've never experienced a traumatic event in my whole life, so I can't help but think it's my own fault anyway. God knows the counseling center is packed as it is so the idea of taking someone's spot if they're in a legitimately rougher place (which is 100% likely, given that I'm not in a rough place at all) isn't something I want to do. And I can hide it fine enough, so nobody knows unless I've explicitly told them, which is as it should be, since pretty much all my relationships with people who did know have all long since ended.

I don't know. What the fuck is the point of trying to get better when the best I can hope for is to not hurt people with my shittier tendencies?"
12/17/2018 20:57:41,I spent more time than necessary wondering how long it took (will take?) for every room in Bechtel to become the site of a sexual act. Including the public spaces.
12/17/2018 21:22:48,Happy winter break everyone!!
12/18/2018 0:17:50,"How the hell do people spend their breaks? I have a terrible relationship with my family so we all despise spending time with each other (or at least I do). I also had a disgustingly bad term. I just want to relax, but I just spend every day of my break being emotionally destroyed even further by these horrible people around me. Seasonal depression has also been really getting to me, and I just can't motivate myself to drive somewhere because it's so gloomy outside. I just want to spend one break where I'm not praying for someone to step on my throat."
12/18/2018 2:21:25,"really wish i could go back to being the silent smart kid like i was in middle school but nope, now i'm just a talkative dumbass with one singular brain cell who would be way better off dead. at least that way i could stop myself from being so fucking annoying all the time."
12/18/2018 8:09:32,I don't feel safe walking around campus at night. I feel like getting between bechtel/avery/annenberg to chandler is pretty sketch. I'm not sure how to fix it but wish there was something to do. The parking lot between annenberg and chandler is weird and creepy and walking around by keck toward bechtel is just so dead and sometimes there are homeless people sleeping in the entrance of the building next to jorgenson.  Hill is equally as sketch at night at there are raccoons and possums. Has anyone found good ways to make this not creepy other than the buddy system? Is there anything we could do?
12/18/2018 8:10:20,The more time I spend at Tech the more I feel like the house system is built for the frosh. It seems stupid to not have all the frosh in the houses. They should just make bechtel a upperclassmen only residence

12/16/2018 7:16:37,"I feel like like the Asian population at caltech is really racist. People here constantly excuse really fd up shit. It’s not really a problem I’ve experienced with Asian people I’ve met elsewhere, other schools, internships, etc, just at caltech. "
12/16/2018 22:10:34,"Women tend to get the impression that I'm a nice, wholesome individual only to discover later, to their extreme disappointment, that I am extremely weird and mentally ill. It's really emotionally painful for me to disappoint people like this. I don't try to put on a mask, I'm just me the whole time. I'm considering getting a face tattoo so this doesn't happen again. "
12/16/2018 22:41:37,"Is it possible to still be successful after failing a class here? I think I just failed a class and I’m so freaked out that I don’t even know what to do. I have so many goals and so many things I know I can accomplish throughout the next few years here but right now I’m worried I won’t be able to do any of it. Worst thing is that I don’t even know where I fucked up - I put in time and effort into the class but I still ended up doing poorly because I just don’t know the topic well enough, and I feel like talking to the prof won’t do any good. Idk what to do "
12/13/2018 0:48:37,"So I filled out the Ph 11 hurdles and turned them in on a whim and I got admitted! Now, I'm sitting here and half of me is excited and the other half is petrified. I keep having this nightmare that the class will be full of would-be Feynmans and I'll be one person who doesn't belong. I don't know.. the whole thing just seems a bit intimidating. "
12/13/2018 1:51:37,"I didn’t pick up any of my sets, quizzes, or midterms as a frost this term. The only grades I looked at were midterm reports and the grades posted on Moodle for Chem 3X. Pretty sure I passed everything though"

12/13/2018 4:46:06,"I don't feel anything. It's as simple as that. I used to be really sad and selfdepricating, and now it's just nothing. I don't know how to help myself, nor do I feel motivated to want to."

12/13/2018 13:39:48,"I am a CS major with an above 4 GPA that applied to 10 jobs and did not get a single one. I am so embarrassed to tell people this because all my friends are under the impression that I am really “smart”, and everyone just assumes I’m getting all these jobs. It hurts every time people come up to me to ask “what are you doing next summer”, and I have to tell them I’ve got nothing. Life fucking sucks. "
12/13/2018 15:30:24,"I find an odd mutual exclusivity at Caltech. The individuals I met who are the most helpful and supportive in an academic environment are smart, yes, and some of the hardest working I know, but they have not been the brightest of Caltech. The brightest stars in the student community have been the least helpful. They don't make themselves accessible to the community, they create an elite group within students of their kind. Administration and faculty notice these students and exacerbate the problem by keeping opportunities exclusive to these students and, therefore, prohibiting access to other students. And this problem exists since the first year of undergraduate. Students who enter with a silver spoon of opportunities become part of this elite community and then have opportunities thrown at them by Caltech. Students who had to work their asses off to get to Caltech, who did not have backgrounds that make them exclusive at Caltech (econ, race, geo, rare opportunities in high school, highly rewarding scholarships that they can't qualify for because of factors beyond their control) have to work ten times harder for even the opportunity to hear what the exclusive community of students can hear. These would be the best students to give extraordinary opportunities because these are the students who amplify the talent of those around them. Their talent allows them to receive knowledge, but their selflessness allows them to disseminate knowledge to raise a whole community. Most of us are diamonds in the rough. We came into Caltech to become the shiniest possible diamonds ever. We listened to the advice of the administration: we asked for help, we went to office hours, we sent the emails, we talked and networked with whoever would talk to us, we used the career development center, we did SURFs, we sought everything thrown to us. Yet we will most likely leave with several of our original dark spots, and the shiny diamonds will leave shinier. You don't have to deprive them of opportunities to be shinier. But let us have our chance to become the same as them."
12/13/2018 19:13:46,"I'm in my first real relationship and I've realized I'm not that physically attracted to him. He's an awesome person and not ugly at all but he's so plain and his body doesn't do anything for me. I always imagined my college relationship would be full of sex but we barely do it now unless I'm feeling particularly guilty that day, and even when we do I can't stop imagining those buff guys I see at Braun on top of me instead which makes me feel even worse. Should I be blaming myself so much for this? What should I do? "
12/14/2018 1:23:39,I want this term to be over but I don't want to leave. I wish I just had a few days to catch my breath and relish being here without drowning.
12/14/2018 8:31:25,"When I first started Caltech, the abuse of the word ""trivially"" annoyed me. Now I use it to flex on frosh"
12/14/2018 9:59:37,My favorite point in the term is when all of your work is turned it but your grades haven’t been posted yet so they just exist in a superpositioned state between all A’s and all F’s
